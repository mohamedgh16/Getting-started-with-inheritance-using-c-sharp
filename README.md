# Getting-started-with-inheritance-using-c#

### Introduction

Inheritance is one of the most important concepts in object-oriented programming. it allows the definition of a class in terms of another class. It also allows us to maintain and boost an application. Classes are created by absorbing the methods and variables of an existing class, It then adds its own methods to enhance its capabilities. This class is called a derived class because it inherits methods and variables from a base class. Objects of a derived class are objects of a base class, but not vice versa. A derived class can only access non-private base class members unless it inherits accessor functions.

### Prerequisites

1. Basic understanding of C# programming language. 
1. Basic understanding of how Classes work.
